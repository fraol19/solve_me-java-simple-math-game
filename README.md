# SolveMe
is a mathematical game built with java swing the game is equiped with 
basic mathematical equations and sequences in which we have to find the 
equations result and missing numbers for sequencial games

# Levels
junior -> (only equations with + and - operators)
medium -> (only equations with * and / operators)
hard ->   (equations with +,-,*,/)
Advance -> (equations with +,-,*,/,^(power) operators)

# Notice the game has random equation and sequence generators you can 
add your own sequnce generators in these program we have 6 sequence 
generators

# Animations are with Timers and Swing components
# Time Bonus and Scoring is based on speed for the answer
# the build jar file is inside dist folder you can run it by double 
clicking or run the command java -jar projecttwo.jar 

# if you want to modify download the files and copy all java files in the src diroctory modify them with any IDE tool (netbeans, Intellij or eclipse) and build your fresh jar file
